▀ Upgrade our bank application version 0.4 to 0.5

▀ Create two classes to our bank application
➢Class name: SavingAccount
• Inherit from Account class
• Contains interest rate member
⁃ The interest rate(%) is determined by the argument of the class 
constructor
➢Class name: HighCreditAccount
• Inherit from SavingAccount class
• Has two interest rate: interest rate (defined in SavingAccount class) 
and special interest rate
⁃ special interest rate(%): depending on the given credit rating(A, B, and 
C), additional interest will be set at 7%, 4% and 2%, respectively.
• To make the program simple, the interest will be paid when you make a 
deposit.
• Make the deposit() member function virtual, so AccountHandler class can call 
the most derived deposit() member function


▀ Modify AccountHandler class
➢Change the program menu to reflect the account type
• Modify MakeAccount() function to select account type. According to 
the selected account type, this function will call 
MakeSavingAccount() or MakeHighCreditAccount().
• Create a MakeSavingAccount() function that creates a saving 
account
• Create a MakeHighCreditAccount() function that creates a high 
credit account
